**Note:** With Angular 16 several breaking changes were introduced, which forced us to also introduce breaking changes
plus we cannot guarantee anymore, that the software is working with Angular 15 and below. This is why we decided to
have a hard cut by introducing a new major release that is only compatible with Angular 16 onwards.
If you want to stick with Angular 14 or Angular 15, please use version 2.10.0.

## Version 2.10.1

* Hotfix: `DataSet.select()` no longer throws an error when using a negative index to deselect all rows

## Version 2.10.0

* Add `sanitizer`, `hiddenWhen`, and `disabledWhen` to `CustomAction` settings
* The `title` attribute in `CustomAction` is now deprecated in favor of `customButtonContent`

## Version 2.9.0

* Add `resizedWidth` property to `Column` which will contain the new declared width of a resized column
* Remove the resizer control from the last column of a table
* Fix the missing action column when the "expand" action was the only enabled action
* Fix the "select all" checkbox being automatically checked when the table contains no data
* Fix the outdated documentation for the emitted events

## Version 2.8.1

* Fixes a regression where `pager.display=false` resulted in showing only 10
  items per page (the default) instead of what was configured in `pager.perPage`.
  Please note that by a previous bug, the `pager.perPage` setting was entirely
  ignored in this situation. I.e. after applying this bugfix, you might need to
  set a proper value for `pager.perPage` in your application.

## Version 2.8.0

* Declare compatibility with Angular 15
* Add new config parameter `strict` for dropdown filters.
  When this is set to `true`, the dropdown will really work like a selection
  instead of a set of predefined search queries. For backwards compatibility,
  the default of this value is `false`.
* Add proper typing for DataSourceChangeEvent
* Add new selection mode `multi_filtered` where the "select all" checkbox selects only
  the elements that match the current filter instead of all elements in the data source
* Add some DataSource methods regarding "select all" to the documentation
* Add settings for conditionally hiding or disabling action buttons
* Remove undocumented 'all' option for `perPage` because that is incompatible with `number`
* Deprecates `expandedRowComponent` and `expand.expandRowButtonContent`
  and adds `expand.component` and `expand.buttonContent` as alternatives
* Fixes that only one sorting parameter is included in a ServerDataSource query
* Fixes that types in data-source.ts were not part of public API
* Fixes several incorrect links to the sources of the demo examples
* Fixes wrong documentation about the available filter types
* Fixes wrong documentation about `valuePrepareFunction` and `filterFunction`.

## Version 2.7.0

## Version 2.6.0

* Adds (editCancel) and (createCancel) events
* Add settings to bypass the Angular sanitizer (e.g. when svg content shall be displayed)
* Fixes type confusion for (edit) and (delete) events and adds proper types to all editing events
* Fixes that pressing escape in the Create Row renders this row dysfunctional
* Fixes inline create row missing placeholder cell if multi-select column is present
* Fixes missing margin between create and cancel button in head form row
* Fixes sorting bug where strings that only start with a number were interpreted as numbers

## Version 2.5.0

* Add new column settings `classHeader` and `classContent`
* Deprecates column setting `class` (remains as alias for `classHeader`)

## Version 2.3.1

* Fixes regression: `filter: false` in a column setting did not work anymore

## Version 2.3.0

* Fixes a regression where selected rows stick to the top of the table after sorting
